# Sequence Analysis
A genomic and proteomic analysis tool which provides a user interface for usage of local BLAST on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Synopsis
[WIP]

## Motivation
Some biologists don't know how to handle big data provided by next generation sequencing. It usually is a tedious task, perfomed mostly on Linux based operating system. This requires a lot of knowledge for the 'regular biologist'. This easy to use user interface aims to make life easier for biologists. 

## Installation
The installer currently has to be run from a Debian based GNU/Linux distro. From there, 
installation is as simple as navigating to the main folder and running ```./installer.sh```.

In the future, we plan to make the installation process OS-independent.

## API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
