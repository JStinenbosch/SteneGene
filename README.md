# Sequence Analysis
A WGS analysis tool which combines Blast, ClustalO, Bedtools ORFfinder and more into a single, streamlined pipeline for protein analysis. 


## Synopsis
[WIP]

## Motivation
[WIP]
## Installation
The installer currently has to be run from a Debian based GNU/Linux distro. From there, 
installation is as simple as navigating to the main folder and running ```./installer.sh```.

In the future, we plan to make the installation process OS-independent.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
